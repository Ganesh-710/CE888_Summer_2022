#In this digital age and exponentially increasing consumer purchasing power every organi-
zation should have an efficient marketing strategy and techniques that help them to increase
customer conversion and retention rate and know the customer better than the previous day
to stay relevant and competitive. One way of doing it is to provide an in-vehicle coupon to
consumers based on their circumstances doing so may result in high expenditure in market-
ing such as Online Banner Ads, Affiliate marketing, etc, and can be time-consuming. To do
this effectively in this project machine learning models such as Random forest, Catboost, and
Logistic regression are used and a comparative analysis has been carried out to pick the best
model its best parameters to predict whether a customer will accept a coupon or not. The
study shows that the various strategies have a considerable difference.
